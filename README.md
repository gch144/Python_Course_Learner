# Running Python Programs with OOP Concepts

This README file provides instructions for running Python programs with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Google Colab`Python_Course.ipynb`. It outlines the steps required to execute the code using the "Run" button for each cell and highlights the incorporation of OOP principles.

## Introduction:
This project aims to demonstrate the execution of Python programs that utilize OOP concepts in Google Colab. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that allows the structuring of code around objects, which have attributes (data) and methods (functions). These instructions will guide you on running the code and understanding the OOP principles incorporated.

##Setting up Google Colab:

* Open Google Colab in your web browser.
* Sign in to your Google account or create a new one if needed.
* Opening the Python Course Notebook:
* In the Google Colab interface, click on "File" in the top-left corner.
* Select "Open notebook" from the dropdown menu.
* Choose the option "GitHub" and enter the URL of the Python course notebook repository.
* Click on the notebook file to open it.

## Running the Code:

* Once the notebook is opened, you will see the code divided into cells.
* Each cell contains a portion of code that can be executed independently.
* To run a cell, click on the "Run" button located on the left side of the cell or press Shift + Enter.
* Proceed to run each cell in sequential order to execute the code step-by-step.

## Exploring the OOP Concepts:
* Throughout the notebook, you will encounter code examples that showcase various OOP concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
* Each code example will be explained with comments and relevant explanations to enhance your understanding of OOP principles.

## Modifying and Experimenting:
* After running the initial code, feel free to modify the provided examples or write your own code snippets to experiment with different OOP concepts.
* You can add cells, edit existing code, or create new code cells to test your ideas and observe the results.


## Conclusion:

By following these instructions, you will be able to run Python programs with OOP concepts . Experimenting with the code and exploring OOP principles will enhance your understanding of object-oriented programming and its implementation in Python.
* Note: It is recommended to have a basic understanding of Python programming and OOP concepts before using this Python course notebook in Google Colab.

Happy coding!
